## Why this project ?
One of the most important components for business success is marketing. Marketing campaigns
can make or break a business, which is exactly why it is crucial to understand its impact on
business, regardless of the industry to which that business is associated. While the logistics of a
business—finances, shipping and delivery, staff hires, etc.—are of course essential, branding
and advertising are also incredibly important to a company’s internal solidarity, customer
outreach, and overall success. It’s hard to overstate the importance of marketing. Every type of
business can benefit from the increased sales and heightened brand awareness that a great
marketing campaign can offer.
The proposed `Digital Marketing Simulator` helps businesses quickly model & simulate the workflow
and ROI of any sales or marketing funnel before making any major marketing decisions. This
tool aims to help businesses devise and test marketing strategies which in turn saves time &
money.
